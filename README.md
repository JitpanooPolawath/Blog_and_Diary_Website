# Blog_and_Diary_Website
Followed Corey Schafer

In this project, I learned Python and Django. How to design and build a website using a locally run server. This website contains a blog post where users can post publically or privately. This allows user to control their post. The post also contains an update, and delete function, where user can change their post later on or delete it entirely. There is a user login and logout, a forget password function that works with email and updating user profiles.
